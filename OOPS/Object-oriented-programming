## What is OOPS?

OOPS is a programming approach where software is designed using **objects**.
An object is a real-world entity that contains **data (attributes)** and **behavior (methods)**.

Example:
`Car` is an object

* Data → color, speed, engine
* Behavior → start(), stop(), accelerate()

## 4 Pillars of OOPS 🏛️

### 1️⃣ Encapsulation

**Meaning:** Wrapping data and methods together and restricting direct access.

✔ Protects data
✔ Improves security

**Example (Python):**

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance   # private variable

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance
```

---

### 2️⃣ Inheritance

**Meaning:** One class acquires properties of another class.

✔ Code reusability
✔ Parent–child relationship

**Example:**

```python
class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        print("Vehicle started")

class Car(Vehicle):
    pass

car = Car()
car.start()
```

---

### 3️⃣ Polymorphism

**Meaning:** Same function name, different behavior.

✔ Flexibility
✔ Method overriding

**Example:**

```python
class Dog:
    def sound(self):
        print("Bark")

class Cat:
    def sound(self):
        print("Meow")

for animal in (Dog(), Cat()):
    animal.sound()
```

---

### 4️⃣ Abstraction

**Meaning:** Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.

✔ Reduces complexity
✔ Focus on what, not how

**Example:**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * 5 * 5
```

## Class vs Object (Very Important)

| Class     | Object        |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Blueprint | Real instance |
| Logical   | Physical      |
| No memory | Uses memory   |

---

## Advantages of OOPS

* Modular code
* Easy maintenance
* Reusability
* Scalable design
* Better security

---

## Interview One-Line Definitions 🧠

* **Encapsulation:** Data hiding using access control
* **Inheritance:** Acquiring properties from parent class
* **Polymorphism:** One interface, many forms
* **Abstraction:** Hiding internal implementation

---

## Where OOPS is Used

* Java, Python, C++
* Spring Boot
* Angular (component-based)
* Real-world software systems
